                <p class="content" id="par-1">With great coding skills and in-depth knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, PYTHON and React JS, I translate high fidelity mock-ups into code or rather taking the design concept from the client and implement it through code and add functionality to come up with quality professional websites. I am also responsible for the behavior and visuals that run in the user browser so that the users can view and interact with a particular website they are visiting. With the continuing arrival of new smart phones, tablets and desktops, I usually ensure that my sites come up correctly in browsers across all devices of different screen sizes. As a developer, I am chiefly concerned with render time, by manipulating the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to ensure that the site opens up quickly. Consequently, I provide clean code with pixel perfect design, make sure that the website works correctly across all devices and works/loads as fast as possible.</p>
